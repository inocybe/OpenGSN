**A Green Cloud Management Middleware**

Most cloud middlewares have been designed in delivering Virtual Machines to its ends users.
The focus is really about offering these pieces of infrastructure regardless about the hosts
or physical location of these virtual machines. OpenGSN is unique because it takes into account
the facilities, their power consumption and environmental properties making it the first 
Green Cloud management middleware available for federated sky computing environments.

Implemented on IaaS Framework
===============================
The fact that OpenGSN middleware is built on top of `IaaS Framework <http://www.inocybe.ca/>` makes
it a reliable and scalable middleware. It benefits from the following underlying framework features:
 
- Simple and high-level abstractions for concurrency and parallelism.

- Faul-Tolerance through supervisor hierarchies with "let-it-crash" semantics. 
  Excellent for writing highly fault-tolerant systems that never stop, systems that self-heal.


Intelligent Follow the Sun Controller
======================================
An high-level controller will try to optimize the global system in order to have the lowest carbon
footprint. It will do so by migrating virtual machines to take advantage of available renewable 
energy.
